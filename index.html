                        <h2>An Overview of Mountain Biking</h2>
                        <p>Mountain bike racing takes place across a wide range of off&ndash;road environments. The sport is divided into several exciting disciplines, including cross&ndash;country, downhill, four&ndash;cross, and freeride — each offering its own unique challenges and thrills.</p>
                        <p>Cross&ndash;country races typically take place in parks, woodlands, and forestry areas. Courses are designed to test a rider&apos;s endurance and skill, often featuring a mix of climbs, descents, and technical elements. These looped circuits are purpose&ndash;built by expert designers and often include man&ndash;made features like rock gardens to ramp up the difficulty.</p>
                        <p>Downhill racing is all about speed and adrenaline. These shorter, point&ndash;to&ndash;point courses make the most of steep terrain and are packed with technical obstacles — think rocks, roots, jumps, and dramatic drop&ndash;offs. Many are custom&ndash;built for competitions, while others are part of permanent bike parks and trail centres.</p>
                        <p>Four&ndash;cross tracks are built for head&ndash;to&ndash;head action. Like downhill courses, they&apos;re laid out on steep terrain with man&ndash;made jumps and berms (banked corners), but they&apos;re much shorter — and wide enough for four riders to race side&ndash;by&ndash;side. It&apos;s fast, furious, and fiercely competitive.</p>
                        <p>Mountain biking isn&apos;t only about racing — it&apos;s about adventure. The UK&apos;s vast network of bridleways and public rights of way stretches for thousands of miles, offering endless routes for riders with a sense of exploration and an Ordnance Survey map in hand.</p>
                        <p>Prefer a more structured experience? Head to one of the many mountain bike trail centres across Britain. These purpose&ndash;built facilities offer clearly marked and graded trails — often set in scenic forestry areas — along with all the essentials: bike hire, cafes, shops, wash stations, and changing rooms. They&apos;re your one&ndash;stop destination for a full day of riding.</p>
