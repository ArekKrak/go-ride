A responsive, multi-section webpage built as the final project for the Codecademy Front-End Developer Career Path course — part of a broader Full-Stack Web Development programme.

This fictional site showcases a UK-wide cycling community, featuring:

- An informative main section on mountain biking disciplines in the UK
- A directory of local club hubs across various cities and regions
- Visuals, CTA buttons, and layout that adapts seamlessly to screen size

---

## Project Overview

This project was the culmination of a front-end development module, focused on HTML5 and CSS3 responsive design principles. It required the practical application of:

- Media queries
- Relative units (`em`, `rem`, `%`)
- Fluid image resizing
- Flexbox layout and positioning

The project brief came from the Codecademy **Responsive Club Website** challenge project. It was open-ended, emphasizing creative decision-making, real-world layout planning, and problem solving.
